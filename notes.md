Positive Space

Assisting Serendipity

A network of helpful entrepreneurs. We connect dreamers and doers in mutually beneficial relationships.

Create your Space. Tell the world what you need in 250 characters or less. Then reach out to like-minded people through their Spaces. It's like platonic dating, or a social network for introverts. All conversations start off private. At the end of every conversation we ask both people to rate it. The more useful you are, the more prominent your Space becomes.



--- Matty - user test
where is the community?
why am i here?
if there is no community why not write a blog?
too many shade of hover for buttons
* add a button right on the prompt to change it inline *
way too much text on the congrats page - did not read
did not read purpose page
check out http://www.volkalize.com/


--- Benn - user test
does not know why he is filling out his profile
urls should not require http://
way too much text on the congrats page - did read
started reading purpose page, opened what is it about and left
link to past conversations of people you're browsing for context
"why would I care about this guy?" too many strangers
* the time on the conversation partial should be of the prompt, put the last_message time at the bottom *
* only use yellow, blue, and red from the logo, only use green when yellow and blue overlap * "This feels like a brand"


--- Subi - user test
the landing page should be a random space, not the main space page
show some sample conversations on the landing page


--- Bugs
bug after registration, clicking get started takes you to log in
everything takes a really long time to load, especially the first page. maybe make the landing page static and then load angular in the background.
twitter may not be working, get ananta to test it.


--- Notes
something should happen after starting a conversation. something exciting.
