 ☐ javascript placeholder directive - try to just roll your own rather than using an existing plugin
 ☐ a user should be able to send as well as recieve +_ messages - to an email address or a +_ username - all autocomplete
 ☐ cleanup head - update title and description and og meta tags
 ☐ add option to control-group directive to display errors as 'tooltip', 'inline', or 'block'
 ☐ add option to control-group directive to display 'info' and 'warning' colors. make the colors work on the tooltips as well
 ☐ add option to display server errors in control-group directive
 ☐ add option to display error tooltips in control-group on focus or blur of the input
 ☐ feature flags -- http://samsworldofno.com/continuous-deployment-with-gradual-feature-rollout/ -- AND -- https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout -- AND -- https://github.com/jrallison/rollout_ui

Backlog:
 ☐ angularize email confirmation
 ☐ make login work on mobile
 ☐ to sign up you need to request an invite through a +_ pitch form
